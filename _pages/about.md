I am a Ph.D. student at Pusan National University in the [Visual Intelligence and Perception Lab](https://pnu-viplab.github.io/) advised by Prof. [Jinsun Park](https://zzangjinsun.github.io/). I am a recipient of the Best Poster Award at 2025 ICRA TIRO workshop. I conducted research internship at STARS Team, INRIA with Prof. [Francois Bremond](https://www-sop.inria.fr/members/Francois.Bremond)
My research focuses on computer vision, particularly in the field of depth perception with multi-sensor fusion and video understanding.
